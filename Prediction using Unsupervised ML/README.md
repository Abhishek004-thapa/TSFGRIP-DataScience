## `Abstract :` 

This project is for the beginner level ML enthusiast just for making them familiar with the various steps of Unsupervised ML algorithms. The dataset used
for this project is of Famous Iris Flower. 

Main aim of this project is to make prediction using Unsupervised ML algorithms such as `K-Means Clustering` 
 as well as provide knowledge about the method of making predictions for unseen data.

`Unupervised ML` is defined by its use of unlabeled datasets or raw data(for each input, their corresponding output is not given) to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. For this task, we have labelled data but we are only using X features and make clusters only using features except targeted one.

## `STEPS: `

  1) Importing required important libraries.
  2) Loading Dataset.
  3) Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization.
  4) Data Spliting  & Model Fitting
  5) Making Prediction on Unseen Data.
  6) Model Evaluation
