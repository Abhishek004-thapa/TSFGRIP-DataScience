## `Abstract :` 

This project is based on multiclass classification problems which is accomplished using following
one of the machine learning algorithm i.e Decision Tree Algorithm. The purpose of using Decision Tree Classifier is if we feed any new data to this classifer, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

3 classes of Iris flowers family:

    i) Iris Setosa
    ii) Iris Verginica
    iii) Iris Versicolor
    
are classified based on the `sepal and petal's length and width`

## `STEPS: `

  1) Importing required important libraries.
  2) Loading dataset.
  3)  Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) & Visualization.
   
      i) Histograms -- Feature's Distribution Analysis of Iris Species
      
      ii) Scatter Plot -- a) Length vs Width of Sepal
      
                          b) Length vs Width of Petal
                          
                          c) Sepal Length vs Petal Length
                          
                          d) Sepal Width vs Petal Width
                          
      iii) Correlation Matrix and HeatMap
      
      iv) Box Plot
      
      v) PairPlot
      
   4) Data Preprocessing
   5) Feature Engineering
   6) Preparing Training & Test Data and Fitting to the model -- Decision Tree Classifier
   7) Model Evaluation -- Metrics Used:
 
                                   a) `Classification Report`
                                   
                                   b) `Confusion Matrix`
                                   
                                   c) `Accuracy Score`  
                                   
   8) Making Prediction on unseen data.
   9) Save a Model and Load it using Pickel.
