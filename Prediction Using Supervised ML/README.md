# `Prediction Using Supervised ML`

## `Dataset :` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv

## `Abstract :` 

This project is for the beginner level ML enthusiast just for making them familiar with the various steps of ML. The dataset used
for this project is also very small and simple. 

Main aim of this project is to make prediction using Supervised ML algorithms such as `LinearRegression` and `RandomForestRegressor` 
for regression based problems as well as provide knowledge about the method of making predictions for unseen data.

`Supervised ML` is defined by its use of labeled datasets(for each input, their corresponding output is given) to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately

## `STEPS: `

  1) Importing required important libraries.
  2) Loading Dataset.
  3) Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization.
  4) Data Spliting  & Model Fitting
  5) Making Prediction on Unseen Data.
  6) Model Evaluation
