# `Prediction Using Supervised ML`

## `Dataset :` https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdiPersonalWorks/Random/master/student_scores%20-%20student_scores.csv

## `Abstract :` 

This project is for the beginner level ML enthusiast just for making them familiar with the various steps of ML. The dataset used
for this project is also very small and simple. 

Main aim of this project is to make prediction using Supervised ML algorithms such as `LinearRegression` and `RandomForestRegressor` 
for regression based problems.

## `STEPS: `

  1) Importing required important libraries.
  2) Loading Dataset.
  3) Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization.
  4) Data Spliting  & Model Fitting
  5) Making Prediction on Unseen Data.
  6) Model Evaluation
